ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
/home/paolo/studio/Numix Calculator1
                        -           

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea/
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/scopes/
* .idea/scopes/scope_settings.xml
* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* NOTICE
* proguard.flags
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/achartengine.jar => app/libs/achartengine.jar
* libs/arity-2.1.6.jar => app/libs/arity-2.1.6.jar
* libs/ejml-0.21.jar => app/libs/ejml-0.21.jar
* libs/slider.jar => app/libs/slider.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
